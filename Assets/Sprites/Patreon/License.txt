25 sprites to go along with the Mythril Age Tilesets! Each sprite is four directional with 4 walking frames.

Mythril Age is an idea I had for a game that ended up turning into something better. The assets I originally started for the game became assets for others to use as well. I release free and paid assets in hopes that it will help other game developers along
their journey and love when I see the assets being used.

Liscence:
You are free to use these assets in your commercial or non-commercial game as well as edit anything you would like. All  I ask is is to maybe add Mythril Age into your games credits. If not, well, that is perfectly fine but it would be nice.
